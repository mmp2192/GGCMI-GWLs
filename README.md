This repository contains Matlab scripts for the data analysis behind the manuscript "Patterns of Future Climate Risks for Agricultural Production By Global Warming Levels." These scripts use crop model data from the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison (GGCMI) project. 

GGCMI data are stored on Globus (https://www.globus.org/). Users who are interested in accessing GGCMI data will need to create a Globus account and contact Christoph Müller (cmueller@pik-potsdam.de) for permission to access the GGCMI group. Other required information, such as driving climate data, crop calendars, and crop area data, are also stored on Globus.

The crop yield data in these analyses have been run through a set of pre-processing scripts to harmonize growing seasons and combine relevant crop seasons. For access to the exact pre-processed GGCMI yield data that was used here, please contact Jonas Jägermeyr (jonas.jaegermeyr@columbia.edu). 

For more information on any of the scripts in this repository, please contact Meridel Phillips (mmp2192@columbia.edu).
